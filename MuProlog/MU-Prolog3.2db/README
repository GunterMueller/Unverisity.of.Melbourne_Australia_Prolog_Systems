MU-Prolog 3.2 Distribution

This is the top level of the MU-Prolog distribution tree.
It should contain the following files and directories:

Makefile
	Main Makefile for the MU-Prolog system.  Before making the system,
	you should check that the configuration parameters are correct for
	your site. Details of how to do this are given in the Makefile.

	To actually create the MU-Prolog system, type:

		make install

	*after* you have fixed the configration parameters. The `make'
	should take around 30 mins on a lightly loaded Vax 11/780.

db/
	Sources for the various database indexing schemes which MU-prolog
	supports.

doc/
	Documentation: including a User Manual (which should already have
	in hard-copy format), and a number of Technical Reports describing
	aspects of the system.

lib/
	Prolog libraries.

lpp/
	Source for a logic pre-processor (written in MU-Prolog) which
	converts logic programs expressed in a language close to first-
	order logic into standard MU-Prolog.

negpp/
	Source for a Negation Pre-Processor (written in MU-Prolog) which
	transforms MU-prolog programs into programs with safe negation.

pllib/
	Prolog libraries.

prolog/
	Source for the MU-Prolog system.
