This directory contains some examples to give a few tips towards using
the MU-Prolog 3.2 database facitlities.

It contains the following files:

brlhp
	Benchmark for RLHP indexing. Run via "prolog < brlhp" once
	you have created the database.

bsimc
	Benchmark for SIMC indexing. Run via "prolog < bsimc" once
	you have created the database.

creatdb
	Shows how to define new database relations. In particular,
	gives a few clues on parameter design. Used by "mkdb".

demo
	Once database is created, run prolog and consult demo.
	This shows how to use MU-Prolog databases, and has a few
	canned queries for you to try.

gendata.c
	Generates some "random" data using numbers, letters of the
	alphabet, and words from "/usr/dict/words". Must be compiled
	before "mkdb" is run. If you don't have a "/usr/dict/words",
	then you will need to modify gendata.c to indicate a file of
	words, one per line.

mkdb
	Shell script to build database and insert some data into it.
	Check your PATH to make sure this will invoke the correct
	version of Prolog.
