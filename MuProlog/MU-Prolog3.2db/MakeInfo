Things you can make:

all	: builds the Prolog binaries but doesn't install them

install	: builds all of the binaries and libraries and installs them

BEFORE you try either of these, edit the Makefile to set up the parameters
for your local configuration; you will probably need to change the values:

HOME	= top level of Prolog source directories (the current directory)
	  [default: /usr/src/melb/prolog]

BIN	= the directory where the Prolog binaries will be installed
	  [default: /usr/melb]

LIB	= the directory where the Prolog libraries will be installed
	  [default: /usr/lib/prolog]

CFLAGS	= flags to the C compiler to indicate which facilities of the
	  MU-Prolog system should be made available (see Makefile for
	  more details)
