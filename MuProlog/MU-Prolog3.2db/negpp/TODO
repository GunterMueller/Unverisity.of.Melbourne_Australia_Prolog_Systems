Reduce spurious error messages from $solutions.

Make system more portable:
	- portraycl
	- occurs
	- ???

Allow multiple quantifiers (at least g_some and some) on the same goal?
-> probably rewrite code more nicely with pred to strip off all "some/all"
quantifiers and collect vars.  Should be able to reduce size of trf and
trf_if considerably.

Check $(Glob) is not necessary in solutions (asserting vars may cause
trouble).  Also insert more hides/protects.

test code for checking local vars (inc local to inner terms), also
clean up this code.

Recognise simple tests and use $ift, or some such thing (?).  Need to
define what a simple test is.  Should X be local with var(X) or do we
have to write if some X var(X) then ... ?

follow up parser bug t((if a(a) then a)).
