This is MU-Prolog release version 3.2 , current on 18-Sep-85.
Also the first released version of the database system, version 3.1a.
Well, actually this is version 3.1.z.

10/85:
Fixed underscore bug in setof1.

Fixed up precedence of -> and ; and implemented it properly.

Jamie (and I) rearranged db interface so several access schemes can be
used together, using dynamic loading.

9/85:
Mods to database interface so we can easily have multiple db access
schemes in the same version (using dynaminc loading eventually).
muprolog pred added (to ease porting between MU-Prolog and NU-Prolog etc).

8/85:
Fixed up comment handling in read and write some more (maybe listing will
always work now...).

7/85:
New form of wait declarations added so member etc, is nicer.
(Later made default old version, since its better with append - when
declarations are much nicer).

use_if, use_else, use_end implemented.

3/85:
Bug in ~= fixed.  Logical version of setof completed.

2/85:
Logic preprocessor made more efficient and added to release stuff.

1984:
The output of listing is now slightly different and can always (I hope)
be read back in.

A bug also crept into next/$fmove some time since I
last used that predicate (several years ago).  Its now fixed.

A few other bugs fixed and mods to make the system more portable and
easier to install.
