Things you can make:

all	: builds the NU-Prolog binaries but doesn't install them

install	: builds all of the binaries and libraries and installs them

BEFORE you try either of these, edit the Makefile to set up the parameters
for your local configuration; you will probably need to change the values:

HOME	= top level of NU-Prolog source directories (the current directory)
	  [default: /usr/src/melb/nuprolog]

BIN	= the directory where the NU-Prolog binaries will be installed
	  [default: /usr/melb]

LIB	= the directory where the NU-Prolog libraries will be installed
	  [default: /usr/lib/nuprolog]

CFLAGS	= flags to the C compiler to indicate which facilities of the
	  NU-Prolog system should be made available (see Makefile for
	  more details)

If you are on a sun, vax, encore, or elxsi, you will want to alter the
rule for inter.o in nep/Makefile, and if you are not on one of these,
then you should look through nep/Makefile and nep/machdep.h very carefully.
You may also need to install Larry Wall's perl.
